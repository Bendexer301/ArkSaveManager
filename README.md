# Ark Save Manager
## Functionality
Manually creating Backups for your Ark Maps is confusing and hard to manage. So why don't do it automatically? The Ark Save Manager saves game profiles, which includes the saves of all maps and their settings. You can make as many as you want if you for example have a singleplayer save of the island, but want to also play with your friends on the same map, but with a different save and also want one to fly around and search for a base on a creative save.
## Usage
To use the Ark Save Manager, you just need to follow the instructions in the setup.bat file. Afterward, you can just start the manager.bat file every time you want to manage your saves.
